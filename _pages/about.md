I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Songhe Feng](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8407/). From March 2023 to March 2024, I was sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and served as a visiting scholar at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/), under the guidance of Professor [Jun Liu](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~jun_liu/). My research focuses on machine learning and data mining, with particular emphasis on multi-view learning and weakly supervised learning.

I'm currently seeking faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., focusing on AI, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning for the 2023-2024 academic year. Feel free to contact me if interested.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
