I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Songhe Feng](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8407/). From March 2023 to March 2024, I was sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and served as a visiting scholar at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/), under the guidance of Professor [Jun Liu](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~jun_liu/). My research focuses on machine learning and data mining, with particular emphasis on multi-view learning and weakly supervised learning.

I'm currently seeking faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., focusing on AI, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning for the 2023-2024 academic year. Feel free to contact me if interested.
